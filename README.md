# pool-info

This console application can show your staked and pending balances you have on PancakeSwap Staking pool (Binance Smart Chain).

It works with Manual Cake pool only, for now. 
Modify 'contract' and 'contract_abi' to query other pools.

The GUI looks nice thanks to [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich).
