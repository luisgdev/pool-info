# pool-info

This console application can show your staked and pending balances you have on PancakeSwap Staking pool (Binance Smart Chain).

I made it to query Manual Cake pool. 
You can query other pools by modifying `pid`, `contract` and `contract_abi`.

Tested on:
- [PancakeSwap Manual Cake pool](https://bscscan.com/address/0x73feaa1eE314F8c655E354234017bE2193C9E24E#code)
- [MDEX Boardroom MDX pool](https://bscscan.com/address/0x6aEE12e5Eb987B3bE1BA8e621BE7C4804925bA68#code)

The GUI looks nice thanks to [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich).
