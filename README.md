# pool-info

This console application can show your staked and pending balances you have on PancakeSwap Staking pool (Binance Smart Chain).

I made it to query Manual Cake pool. 
You can query other pools by modifying `contract` and `contract_abi`.

The GUI looks nice thanks to [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich).
